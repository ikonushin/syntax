## 📊 Understanding the Data

### Receipt Statistics
- **Count**: Total number of receipt entries created
- **Total**: Sum of all receipt amounts
- **Average**: Total ÷ Count (mean receipt value)

### Period Calculations

| Period | Timeframe | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Week | Last 7 calendar days | Nov 2-8, 2025 |
| Month | 1st to today of current month | Nov 1-9, 2025 |
| Year | Last 12 calendar months | Nov 2024 - Nov 2025 |

### Top Clients Ranking
- Based on **total amount** received from each client
- Not based on number of transactions
- Example: Client with 1 transaction of 10,000₽ ranks higher than client with 10 transactions of 500₽ each
